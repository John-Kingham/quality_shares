# Quality Shares

- [Live website on Heroku](https://quality-shares-3f67cc1f7e60.herokuapp.com/) 

Quality Shares is an informative and educational website for "quality investors"; in other words, investors seeking high-quality income and growth stocks.

I built the site for Jim Smith, a (fictional) financial analyst with 20 years’ experience. 

Jim was looking for a challenge and wanted to start his own business to leverage his extensive knowledge as an investor and analyst. He likes writing, so he wanted to launch a paid blog/newsletter business.

Jim already has a Substack where he publishes free weekly articles to build up his audience. He wanted to move from Substack to a bespoke website to give him (a) more control over the platform’s structure, and (b) more flexibility with potential future product offerings, such as books, courses, coaching, etc.

## User Experience Design

I designed the site using the "five planes" UX design process.

### Strategy Plane

#### Product Owner Goals

- Primary goal:
  - To give Jim a bespoke, flexible platform that will help him grow his business.
- Supporting goals:
  - To raise awareness of Jim's business, so that more users enter the top of the funnel.
  - To use subtle trust-building styling to build trust with users.
  - To publish free content for its SEO value and to nurture users with educational and informational content.
  - To make it easy for users to sign up for premium content.
  - To make it easy for users to subscribe to email newsletters, so we remain top of mind with leads.

#### User goals

- Primary goal:
  - To improve my investment returns.
- Supporting goals:
  - To learn more about investing and become a better investor.
  - To have access to information about companies, stock prices and stock markets that will help me make better-informed investing decisions.

### Structure Plane

To fulfil the user stories, I designed the site to have the following structural elements:

### Skeleton Plane

I used wireframes to add detail to the structural elements above. These wireframes were not intended to be used as blueprints, so there are some minor differences between them and the site's final design, mostly due to user feedback.

### Surface Plane

#### Colour palette

The colour palette was inspired by the colours used by [Hargreaves Lansdown](https://www.hl.co.uk/).

- #ABC123 - EXAMPLE COLOUR!

#### Custom fonts

The site uses two custom fonts from Google Fonts.

- XXX: EXAMPLE FONT
- ZZZ: EXAMPLE FONT

#### Content

All model-based content (e.g. blog posts, portfolio page content) was generated using [Microsoft Co-Pilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).
