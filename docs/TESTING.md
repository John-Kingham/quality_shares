# Quality Shares - Automated Testing

The Django project has three apps (about, blog and portfolio), each of which has a `test_views.py` file containing unit tests.

## About App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestAboutView|test_about_page|Pass|

## Blog App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestBlogViews|test_post_list_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_post_detail_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_category_list_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_new_comment_submission|Pass|

Tests for editing and deleting comments would have been ideal, but these were not a required part of the project and were deferred due to time constraints.

## Portfolio App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestPortfolioView|test_portfolio_page|Pass|

## Admin Site Functionality

The admin site is a built-in part of Django, so I didn't test it as thoroughly as the parts I coded. However, I did run some basic tests to ensure the required functionality was there.

### About Admin

## Acceptance Tests

Each user story has one or more acceptance criteria that has to be met before the story can be considered done. You can read the acceptance criteria for each user story in the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/John-Kingham/projects/14).

All acceptance criteria have been met for implemented user stories.

## Colour Contrast

I tested colour contrasts using [colourcontrast.cc](https://colourcontrast.cc/) because the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) site was down.

### White + Primary

This combination is used across the site for headings and passes all tests.

![White/primary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/white-primary-blue.png)

### White + Secondary

This combination is mostly used for buttons and passes all tests at the minimum AA standard.

![White/secondary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/white-secondary-blue.png)

### Tertiary + Primary

This combination is used for the header navigation bar, footer text, outline buttons in the hover state and other areas where a light background colour is used. It passes all tests.

![Tertiary/primary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/tertiary-primary.png)

### Tertiary Highlight + Primary

This combination is used in the header navigation bar on hover. It passes all tests.

![Tertiary-highlight/primary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/tertiary-highlight-primary.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Secondary

This combination is used in the premium content info panel and for unapproved comments. It passes all tests at the minimum AA standard.

![BS Light/Secondary](./images/testing/contrast/bs-light-secondary.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Bootstrap Body Color

This combination is used for unapproved comments. It passes all tests.

![BS Light/BS Body](./images/testing/contrast/bs-light-bs-body-color.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Bootstrap Danger

This combination is used for unapproved comments. It only passes the AA Large test, but as this combination is only used with bold text, this is acceptable.

## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

HTML was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

#### Home HTML Validation

![Homepage HTML validation results](./images/testing/validation/home-html-validation.png)

There were four errors relating to unnecessary ARIA roles. I fixed these warnings by removing the offending roles.

There was one error relating to an unnecessary closing `li` tag. I fixed this error by removing the offending tag.

I revalidated the page and there were no errors or warnings.

![Homepage HTML validation fixed results](./images/testing/validation/home-html-validation-fixed.png)

#### Post Detail HTML Validation

![Post Detail HTML validation errors](./images/testing/validation/post-detail-html-validation-errors.png)

There was one warning about a section without a heading. To fix this, I changed the section to a div.

There was one warning about an article without a heading. This was a comment. To fix this, I changed the comment meta-info into a heading.

There was one error about the use of aria-labelledby on a plain div. I fixed this by giving the div a role of `dialog`.

I revalidated the page and there were no errors or warnings.

![Post Detail HTML validation fixed](./images/testing/validation/post-detail-html-validation-fixed.png)

#### Archive HTML Validation

![Archive HTML validation errors](./images/testing/validation/archive-html-validation-errors.png)

There were two errors relating to an unclosed section element. The closing element was outside the `{% endblock content %}` statement, so I moved it inside.

I revalidated the page and there were no errors or warnings.

![Archive HTML validation fixed](./images/testing/validation/archive-html-validation-fixed.png)

#### Portfolio HTML Validation

![Portfolio HTML validation errors](./images/testing/validation/portfolio-html-validation-errors.png)

There was one warning about a missing section heading. I fixed this by changing the section to a div. I thought the about page would have the same defect, which it did, so I applied the same fix to the about page.

I revalidated the page and there were no errors or warnings.

![Portfolio HTML validation fixed](./images/testing/validation/portfolio-html-validation-fixed.png)

#### About HTML Validation

![About HTML validation success](./images/testing/validation/about-html-validation.png)

There were no errors or warnings.

### CSS Validation

CSS validation was carried out using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

#### style.css Validation

![CSS validation errors](./images/testing/validation/css-validation-errors.png)

There was one error relating to an empty `var()` function. To fix this, I removed the empty call and its CSS selector. 

There were also three warnings about CSS variables not being statically checked. These warnings are unavoidable and do not need to be fixed.

I revalidated the CSS and there were no errors.

![CSS validation success](./images/testing/validation/css-validation-fixed.png)

### JavaScript Validation

JavaScript validation was carried out using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

#### comments.js

![JS validation messages](./images/testing/validation/js-validation.png)

There was one warning about `bootstrap` being an undefined variable. This is expected and is okay as the bootstrap JS is loaded by the HTML file before this custom JS file.

### Python Validation

Python code was validated using the [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).

#### about/admin.py

![About admin.py validation](./images/testing/validation/about-admin-py-validation.png)

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

There were many bugs created and squashed throughout the construction phase. Many of these were fixed before the buggy code was commited, and therefore didn't make it into the commit history. Other bugs were fixed after the defect had been committed, so a separate fix commit had to be created. 

Bug fix commits have a commit message prefixed with `fix`, so they're easy to identify within the commit history and are listed here for reference:

- fix: add missing social media links
- fix: only show published posts
- fix: add homepage links to site logo and title
- fix: restore portfolio image caption
- fix: fix errors with comment html structure
- fix: make site title visible on mobiles
- fix: add padding to unapproved comments
- fix: fix comment form margin
- fix: fix overlapping unapproved comments
- fix: remove unnecessary HTML roles and tags
- fix: fix post detail HTML validation issues
- fix: fix post archive HTML validation issues
- fix: fix portfolio and about HTML issues
- fix: remove empty CSS var() call
- fix: don't always show the premium content panel

### Unfixed Bugs

There are no unfixed bugs that I am aware of. Having said that, even after thorough testing I cannot completely rule out the possibility of some hidden bugs.
