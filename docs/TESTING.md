# Quality Shares - Automated Testing

The Django project has three apps (about, blog and portfolio), each of which has a `test_views.py` file containing unit tests.

## About App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestAboutView|test_about_page|Pass|

## Blog App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestBlogViews|test_post_list_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_post_detail_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_category_list_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_new_comment_submission|Pass|

Tests for editing and deleting comments would have been ideal, but these were not a required part of the project and were deferred due to time constraints.

## Portfolio App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestPortfolioView|test_portfolio_page|Pass|

## Admin Site Functionality

The admin site is a built-in part of Django, so I didn't test it as thoroughly as the parts I coded. However, I did run some basic tests to ensure the required functionality was there.

## Colour Contrast

I tested colour contrasts using [colourcontrast.cc](https://colourcontrast.cc/) as the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) site was down.

### White + Primary

This combination is used across the site for headings and passes all tests.

![White/primary contrast](/docs/images/testing/contrast/white-primary-blue.png)

### White + Secondary

This combination is mostly used for buttons and passes all tests at the minimum AA standard.

![White/secondary contrast](/docs/images/testing/contrast/white-secondary-blue.png)

### Tertiary + Primary

This combination is used for the header navigation bar, footer text, outline buttons in the hover state and other areas where a light background colour is used. It passes all tests.

![Tertiary/primary contrast](/docs/images/testing/contrast/tertiary-primary.png)

### Tertiary Highlight + Primary

This combination is used in the header navigation bar on hover and it passes all tests.

![Tertiary-highlight/primary contrast](/docs/images/testing/contrast/tertiary-highlight-primary.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Secondary

This combination is used in the premium content info panel and for unapproved comments. It passes all tests at the minimum AA standard.

![BS Light/Secondary](/docs/images/testing/contrast/bs-light-secondary.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Bootstrap Body Color

This combination is used for unapproved comments and it passes all tests.

![BS Light/BS Body](/docs/images/testing/contrast/bs-light-bs-body-color.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Bootstrap Danger

This combination is used for unapproved comments. It only passes the AA Large test, but as this combination is only used with bold test, this is acceptable.
