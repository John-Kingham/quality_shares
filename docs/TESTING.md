# Quality Shares - Automated Testing

The Django project has three apps (about, blog and portfolio), each of which has a `test_views.py` file containing unit tests.

## About App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestAboutView|test_about_page|Pass|

## Blog App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestBlogViews|test_post_list_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_post_detail_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_category_list_view|Pass|
|TestBlogViews|test_new_comment_submission|Pass|

Tests for editing and deleting comments would have been ideal, but these were not a required part of the project and were deferred due to time constraints.

## Portfolio App Tests

|Test Class|Test Method|Status|
|---|---|---|
|TestPortfolioView|test_portfolio_page|Pass|

## Admin Site Functionality

The admin site is a built-in part of Django, so I didn't test it as thoroughly as the parts I coded. However, I did run some basic tests to ensure the required functionality was there.

## Colour Contrast

I tested colour contrasts using [colourcontrast.cc](https://colourcontrast.cc/) as the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) site was down.

### White + Primary

This combination is used across the site for headings and passes all tests.

![White/primary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/white-primary-blue.png)

### White + Secondary

This combination is mostly used for buttons and passes all tests at the minimum AA standard.

![White/secondary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/white-secondary-blue.png)

### Tertiary + Primary

This combination is used for the header navigation bar, footer text, outline buttons in the hover state and other areas where a light background colour is used. It passes all tests.

![Tertiary/primary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/tertiary-primary.png)

### Tertiary Highlight + Primary

This combination is used in the header navigation bar on hover and it passes all tests.

![Tertiary-highlight/primary contrast](./images/testing/contrast/tertiary-highlight-primary.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Secondary

This combination is used in the premium content info panel and for unapproved comments. It passes all tests at the minimum AA standard.

![BS Light/Secondary](./images/testing/contrast/bs-light-secondary.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Bootstrap Body Color

This combination is used for unapproved comments and it passes all tests.

![BS Light/BS Body](./images/testing/contrast/bs-light-bs-body-color.png)

### Bootstrap Light + Bootstrap Danger

This combination is used for unapproved comments. It only passes the AA Large test, but as this combination is only used with bold test, this is acceptable.

## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

HTML was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

#### Home HTML Validation

![Homepage HTML validation results](./images/testing/validation/home-html-validation.png)

There were four errors relating to unnecessary ARIA roles. I fixed these warnings by removing the offending roles.

There was one error relating to an unnecessary closing `li` tag. I fixed this error by removing the offending tag.

I re-validated the page and there were no errors or warnings.

![Homepage HTML validation fixed results](./images/testing/validation/home-html-validation-fixed.png)

#### Post Detail HTML Validation

![Post Detail HTML validation errors](./images/testing/validation/post-detail-html-validation-errors.png)

There was one warning about a section without a heading. To fix this, I changed the section to a div.

There was one warning about an article without a heading. This was a comment. To fix this, I changed the comment meta-info into a heading.

There was one error about the use of aria-labelledby on a plain div. I fixed this by giving the div a role of `dialog`.
